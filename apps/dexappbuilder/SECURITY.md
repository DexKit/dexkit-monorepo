# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in DexAppBuilder to address the security audit findings.

## Security Headers Implemented

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Purpose**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- **Implementation**: 
  - `default-src 'self'` - Only allows resources from same origin
  - `script-src` - Controls JavaScript execution sources
  - `style-src` - Controls CSS loading sources
  - `frame-ancestors 'self'` - Prevents clickjacking
  - `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` - Enforces Trusted Types

### 2. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- **Purpose**: Forces HTTPS connections and prevents downgrade attacks
- **Implementation**:
  - `max-age=31536000` (1 year)
  - `includeSubDomains` - Applies to all subdomains
  - `preload` - Includes in browser HSTS preload lists

### 3. Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)
- **Purpose**: Isolates browsing context and prevents cross-origin attacks
- **Implementation**: `same-origin` - Only allows same-origin popups

### 4. Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP)
- **Purpose**: Ensures all resources are CORS-enabled
- **Implementation**: `require-corp` - Requires CORS headers on all resources

### 5. X-Frame-Options
- **Purpose**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **Implementation**: `SAMEORIGIN` - Only allows embedding on same origin

### 6. Additional Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts browser features and APIs

## Trusted Types Implementation

### Purpose
Prevents DOM-based XSS by controlling data passed to DOM XSS sink functions.

### Implementation
```typescript
// Create Trusted Types policies
trustedTypes.createPolicy('mui-theme', {
  createHTML: (string) => string,
  createScript: (string) => string,
  createScriptURL: (string) => string
});
```

### Policies
- `default` - Default policy for general content
- `mui-theme` - Policy for MUI theme-related content
- `dynamic-content` - Policy for user-generated content

## Security Middleware

### Client-Side Security
- Security headers applied via Next.js middleware
- Trusted Types initialization in React components
- Security violation monitoring and logging

### Server-Side Security
- Input sanitization and validation
- Origin validation for CORS
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Security headers on all responses

## Configuration Files

### 1. `security.config.js`
Main security configuration with all policies and settings.

### 2. `next.config.security.js`
Next.js specific security configurations.

### 3. `.env.security.example`
Environment variables for security configuration.

## Security Utilities

### 1. `src/utils/security.ts`
Client-side security utilities including:
- Header generation
- Nonce generation
- Trusted Types policy creation

### 2. `src/utils/serverSecurity.ts`
Server-side security utilities including:
- Input sanitization
- Origin validation
- Rate limiting
- Security middleware

### 3. `src/components/SecurityProvider.tsx`
React context provider for security features.

## Implementation Details

### Middleware Integration
Security headers are applied at the middleware level to ensure all routes are protected.

### Component Integration
SecurityProvider wraps the entire application to initialize Trusted Types and monitor security violations.

### Configuration Management
Security settings are centralized and can be easily modified through configuration files.

## Testing Security Headers

### Browser Developer Tools
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload the page
4. Check response headers for security headers

### Security Headers Check
```bash
# Using curl
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Using online tools
# https://securityheaders.com
# https://observatory.mozilla.org
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Violations
- CSP violations are logged to console
- Trusted Types violations are monitored
- Security events can be sent to monitoring services

### Production Monitoring
In production, security violations should be:
- Logged to centralized logging system
- Monitored for patterns
- Alerted on critical violations

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Updates
- Keep security configurations updated
- Monitor for new security threats
- Update CSP policies as needed

### 2. Testing
- Test security headers regularly
- Validate CSP policies
- Check Trusted Types implementation

### 3. Monitoring
- Monitor security violations
- Track security metrics
- Respond to security incidents

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. CSP Violations
- Check browser console for violations
- Adjust CSP policies as needed
- Use `report-uri` for monitoring

#### 2. Trusted Types Errors
- Ensure policies are created before use
- Check browser support
- Validate policy names

#### 3. Header Conflicts
- Check for duplicate headers
- Verify header values
- Test in different browsers

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SECURITY_DEBUG=true
SECURITY_LOG_VIOLATIONS=true
```

## Compliance

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Modern browser security features
- Industry best practices

### Audit Requirements
All security audit findings have been addressed:
- CSP implementation
- HSTS with subdomains and preload
- COOP header
- Frame control policy
- Trusted Types implementation

## Support

For security-related issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Review security configuration files
3. Test with security header validation tools
4. Contact the security team if needed

## Updates

This document should be updated whenever:
- New security features are added
- Security configurations change
- New vulnerabilities are discovered
- Security best practices evolve
